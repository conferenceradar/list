## Conference Radar

This project was created with the goal of maintaining a community list of tech conferences and their status in light of Covid-19. 

## How to help

If you see any errors, have an event to add, or add detail to an event that is currently listed, please file an issue.

### Add Details

2. Edit the form as completely as possible and click 'Save'
3. We moderate all conference submissions so it may not show up right away but have been publishing updated conference listings multiple times a day
